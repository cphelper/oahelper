1
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,457
Bullshit.

2
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,667
It is this friggin' wide.

3
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,169
And it's periodic.

4
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,546
Bull. Shit.

5
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,631
Show me.

6
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,014
Something terrestrial, gotta be.

7
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,266
Bouncing off the moon.

8
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,685
Gee. I never thought to check that.

9
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,021
Look at that slope, man.

10
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,940
You could ski down that thing.

11
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,316
It is drifting.

12
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,152
Look here. Zoom in. Zoom in.

13
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,570
See that variation?

14
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,407
And look. This gap here?
This is where it stops, then starts over.

15
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,035
-It repeats?
-Every 78 seconds.

16
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,494
The whole entire thing.

17
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,831
Three hours straight, and no end in sight.

18
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,169
It can't be.

19
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,726
It's gotta be something
bouncing off the... off the...

20
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,895
It's not bouncing off the moon, Dave.

21
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,065
Well, maybe it's those Chatty Cathys
at the Forest Service.

22
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,360
I hate those guys. Always on their radios,
talking about trees.

23
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,446
Dave, it's not Smokey Bear
we're picking up.

24
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:34,613
Look at that signal.

25
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,198
It's drifting.

26
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,492
What is it, then?

27
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,210
Looks like simple pulse-width modulation.
Old-school, like Morse code.

28
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:53,090
Maybe somehow,
it's the time signal out of Fort Collins.

29
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,926
-They use pulse-width modulation.
-It's not the atomic clock.

30
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,429
The atomic clock changes every minute
because it's a clock.

31
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,348
This is the same exact data
repeated every 78 seconds.

32
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:06,645
Plus, this is coming
from 600 light-years away.

33
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:12,150
This Morse code of yours
seems to be split four ways.

34
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,323
The pulses are of equal duration,

35
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:20,159
but they're positioned
across four different frequencies.

36
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:23,579
-Looks like a player piano.
-So not binary but base four.

37
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,997
Quaternary.

38
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,333
This won't be easy to crack.

39
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,718
No, no. If you look at this. Look at...

40
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,347
What do you think it says?

41
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,017
Maybe just,
"Hello. Hey, hey. We're out here."

42
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,687
What did we put on Voyagers 1 and 2?
Chuck Berry?

43
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,899
Maybe this is just
their version of "Johnny B. Goode."

44
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,069
Imagine the power it took to send it.

45
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,489
Megawatts?

46
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,823
Gigawatts?

47
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,743
And that's if it's pointed only at us.

48
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,370
Antenna the size of Africa.

49
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,621
-Mm-hmm.
-Bigger.

50
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,167
You go to all that trouble
to send a message,

51
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,878
it's gotta be more than just "hello."

52
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,839
And why make it hard to understand?

53
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,466
Quaternary?

54
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:21,553
That's like encryption.
Why would you bother to...

55
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,105
It's not quaternary.

56
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,987
I think I know what it is.

57
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,866
<i>The twin moons hung low and full.</i>

58
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,702
Two wine-green eyes
peering over the horizon

59
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,204
as if to steal a glimpse
into Lucasia's soul.

60
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,041
She paced the blood-soaked decks
of the <i>Mercator,</i>

61
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:36,003
looking for something, anything,
that might take her mind off Raban.

62
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:40,841
Ascending the forecastle, her gaze
lingered over a bare-chested young sailor.

63
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,219
On hands and knees he scrubbed,

64
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:47,723
his sinewy forearms stretched taut as he
washed away all trace of the day's fight.

65
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,059
With a languid nod...

66
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,479
...Lucasia bade him follow to her cabin.

67
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,275
Little did this callow deckhand know
that serving at his captain's pleasure

68
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,111
might take on such sweet meaning.

69
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:05,366
Or, regrettably,
that it would last but a single night.

70
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:12,706
Later, at four bells,
Lucasia stood by the mizzenmast.

71
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,959
Once again, she was alone.

72
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,712
She pulled her topcoat tighter,

73
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,841
fingering its coarse wool
as her thoughts flashed back to Raban.

74
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:25,177
It had been he who first wrapped
the coat around her,

75
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,054
whispering in her ear,

76
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:31,517
"May this keep you warm
in my absence, <i>ma chérie</i>."

77
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:37,064
With that, Raban, proud, haughty Raban,

78
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,192
mounted the plank and leaped from sight.

79
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,278
The am a ran thine
slips and closed over him,

80
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,906
leaving nary a ripple.

81
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,741
Aw...

82
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:02,131
Attention, lovers of
speculative historical romance literature,

83
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:05,843
best-selling author Carol Sturka
will now sign her new novel,

84
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,428
<i>"Bloodsong of Wycaro,"</i>

85
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,680
the fourth book in her
"<i>Winds of Wycaro"</i> trilogy.

86
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,641
"Why-car-oh," please!
It's "Winds of Why-car-oh!"

87
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,978
And <i>Bloodsong</i> is the best yet.

88
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,730
God, are you in for a treat.

89
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,691
Let's go sign books!

90
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,821
{\an8}Raban is alive, right?

91
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,573
{\an8}Maureen. You could read it.

92
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,200
{\an8}Well, I will. Tonight.

93
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,327
{\an8}I've already unplugged the phone.

94
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,037
{\an8}Just, uh...

95
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,539
{\an8}-Raban's not on the cover.
-No, he's not.

96
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:39,042
{\an8}And he... he's never not been
on the cover, Carol.

97
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:41,295
{\an8}If Raban doesn't come back...

98
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,422
{\an8}...I'm done.

99
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:45,174
Come here.

100
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,051
Page 218.

101
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,682
-Okay. Thank you.
-Okay. Bye.

102
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,850
Thanks, Maureen.

103
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,603
-Okay, this is Olga.
-Hi. Hi, Olga.

104
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,066
Hi, Yvette!

105
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,319
Hi!

106
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:06,987
Love it.

107
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,075
-Happy reading.
-This is Nicky, with a pillow.

108
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,202
{\an8}-Nicky with a... Oh, my gosh!
-I made it myself.

109
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,037
{\an8}-Look at that. You made this?
-Yes.

110
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,122
This is Christine.

111
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,290
This is Paulina and support person.

112
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,458
-This is Carlotta.
-Hi.

113
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,168
Say, "Raban".

114
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,920
Raban.

115
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,339
When Raban and Eldgammel
fell in the cargo hold,

116
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,299
do you remember what it was loaded with?

117
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,592
Mandovian spice fruit.

118
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,761
Which Lucasia is...

119
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,721
Deathly allergic to!

120
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,265
{\an8}-Oh, you guys run a fan club?
-Of course!

121
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,396
-Thank you so much!
-Thank you.

122
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,480
-Hi, Tanya.
-Hi!

123
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,690
-Are you excited?
-Yes.

124
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:43,983
-Hi, Yvonne.
-Hi.

125
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,901
I got two books, one for the tub.

126
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,946
This is a authentic cutlass
just like Raban's.

127
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,698
-Okay.
-Careful, it's really sharp.

128
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,283
Okay, so three things.

129
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:55,578
When finally are they
gonna make a "<i>Wycaro"</i> movie?

130
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:58,581
And please tell me it'll be in actual
theaters, not on the Lifetime Network.

131
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,916
You gotta get ILM to do the slips and,

132
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,461
otherwise it's just gonna look like <i>merde,</i>
pardon my French.

133
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:07,131
A small but very crucial point,

134
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:11,969
as a two-masted schooner, the <i>Mercator</i>
would not possess a mizzenmast. So...

135
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,805
Craig, I'm gonna need you
to put this back in the bag

136
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,473
before the store manager sees it.

137
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,350
-Oh.
-Right.

138
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,852
-Your humble servant.
-Thank you.

139
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,564
Oh, that's the one.

140
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,023
Thank you so much.

141
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,610
-We'll see you at the next one.
-Happy reading.

142
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,570
All right. All right.

143
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:37,161
Hi, ladies. I have us
going to the Hyatt Regency Dallas.

144
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,580
Hi. Yeah. Thanks, uh, perfect.

145
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,834
That was quite a send-off.
I'm sorry, should I know who you are?

146
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:47,171
Uh, depends.
You a big fan of mindless crap?

147
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,248
Morning, Doc.

148
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:24,458
Well, it certainly is.

149
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,127
-Hey, Mel.
-Hey.

150
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,254
Ooh, where'd those come from?

151
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:30,839
Yours truly.

152
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,592
Help yourself.
I think they're mostly glazed,

153
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,679
but one box ought to be sprinkled,
powdered and all that.

154
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:38,472
What did we do to deserve this?

155
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,934
Ah, my 14-year-old's selling 'em
for marching band.

156
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,520
{\an8}Well, aren't you a good dad.

157
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:47,231
{\an8}-What does she play?
-Trombone.

158
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,484
{\an8}-Doctor D!
-Good evening.

159
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,278
{\an8}Morning. Whatever.

160
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,572
{\an8}-Look what Mel brought.
-Ooh, for us?

161
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:55,823
{\an8}Yeah, please.

162
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,616
They got you two working late.

163
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,118
Yeah. I gotta gas a bunch of rats.

164
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,829
So, how goes the big project?

165
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,540
What have you heard?

166
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:07,125
I don't know. Things.

167
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,086
Well...

168
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,338
Our team's fairly certain
we've got a sequence

169
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,923
that encodes for a lysogenic virus.

170
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,842
But after eight whole months
of animal testing...

171
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,761
Macaques, rabbits, mice...

172
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:19,471
-Guinea pigs.
-Guinea pigs. Now rats.

173
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,057
No clinical signs whatsoever.

174
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,769
Put another way...

175
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:27,604
we got bubkes.

176
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,523
We got bubkes.

177
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,748
Okay, how do you wanna do this?

178
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,586
Uh, I can put 'em to sleep
if you wanna do the cardiac sticks.

179
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,589
I hate the cardiac sticks.

180
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,924
Well, you're more than welcome
to gas them.

181
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,927
I hate gassing them.

182
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,804
Might be in the wrong career.

183
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,389
All right, cardiac sticks it is.

184
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,725
Let's get it over with.

185
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,811
Uh-oh.

186
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:10,606
Check it out.

187
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:12,399
Oh, damn.

188
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,235
What do you figure happened there?

189
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:22,367
I don't know.

190
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,600
He's looking pretty dead to me.

191
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,020
You got a heartbeat?

192
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,022
I can't feel jack shit in these gloves.

193
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:01,490
Huh.

194
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:02,783
Huh, what?

195
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,494
He's absolutely got a heartbeat.

196
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,621
A strong one. Just bam, bam, bam.

197
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,373
It's weird.
